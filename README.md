Object Detection:

The haarcascade_eye.xml file is opensource and not created by us, it is only linked here to help whomever test the object Detection Algorithm

The object detection algorithm when ran will capture your laptops video, and then apply a ROI (Region of Interest) for the parts of the video that are detected to be similar to the contents of the xml file. With the haarcascade_eye.xml file, it will apply a ROI around your eyes when captured from your webcam video.
